The department wishes to have a system that can keep track of various events that the students of the department can participate in. Events can include seminars, competitions etc. An event can be announced by the department or can be external. Every event has requirements e.g. who can register, how many can register etc. Once announced, students taking part in the event must register for the event. Once the event is complete, news/pictures about the event may be uploaded. The event may also be rated by teachers and students.
